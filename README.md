A tool to validate the configuration files for all lightweight components based on the schema described by the component

##Setting up Dev Environment
- Fork and clone the repository
- Create a virtualenv with Python > 2.7 and install the requirements from requirements.txt
- Activate the virtualenv 
- To run the validation engine, use
```python
python ./config_validation_engine/config_validation_engine.py --schema {SCHEMA_FILE} --data {DATA_FILE}
```
- If you need to add your own validators, they should be added in config_validation_engine/validators package
- The final data that needs to be validated is the augmented_site_level_configuration_file.yaml that is generated by the SIMPLE Grid YAML Compiler. A sample of it is available [here](https://github.com/WLCG-Lightweight-Sites/wlcg_lightweight_site_ce_cream/blob/master/augmented_site_level_config_file.yaml)
